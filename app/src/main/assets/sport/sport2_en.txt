After the push-ups, you can make a slight adjustment. Find a support point (slow chair or other hard furniture) with a height of about 30 cm. If it is too high, it will lead to imbalance. If it is too low, it will weaken the fitness effect. Action essentials: Keep the push-ups on the upper body, put the forefoot on the support point and do the push-ups. The arms and shoulders are parallel. The palms are on the sides of the shoulders. The palms are all on the ground. The frequency of the push-ups can be slowed down slightly. And insist on doing 4 groups, 12 in each group.
